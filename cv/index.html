			<li><strong>Hydroponic Farming With IoT</strong><br>
				<em>Key Points/Achievements:</em><br>
				&nbsp; - The goal of this project was to design and construct a HFE which is fully automatic that can be integrated into the agricultural curriculum while introducing business skills.<br>
				&nbsp; - Proposed an Hydroponic Farming Ecosystem (HFE) that uses IoT devices to monitor humidity, nutrient solution temperature, air temperature, PH and Electrical Conductivity (EC). The HFE is made to support agricultural practices by farmers, non-professional farmers, city people who have limited knowledge in farming and people who are interested in doing vertical planting in very small areas in the city such as building tops, balconies of small rooms in high-rise buildings, and in small office spaces. To make the system easy to control and easy to use, we came up with web dashboard to control IoT devices in the HFE and alarm users when their farm is in an abnormal situation.<br>
